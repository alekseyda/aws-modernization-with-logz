# Self-Paced Workshop

Welcome to the Self Guided Setup section! This workshop requires an AWS account where there is IAM user/identity that has proper permissions to set up the necessary AWS components to work through the workshop. Worried about costs associated with this workshop? Don't worry, there's a page that will allow you to request for AWS credits to pay for any costs incurred through this workshop!

Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:

1. Creating an AWS account with proper permissions
1. Creating an EKS Cluster
1. Creating a Logz.io Trial Account
