Welcome to the Self Guided Setup section! This workshop requires an AWS account where there is IAM user/identity that has proper permissions to set up the necessary AWS components to work through the workshop.

Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:
- Setup an AWS account and user
- Setup a VPC (optional)
- Setup Cloud9 Environment
