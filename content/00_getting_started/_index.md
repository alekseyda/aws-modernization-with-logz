# Getting Started

Welcome! Observability has become a crucial part of modern software development and operations. In today's fast-paced, complex software systems, it's not enough to simply monitor your applications and infrastructure. You need to have a deep understanding of how your systems are behaving and why they are behaving that way. This is where observability comes in.

In this workshop, we will cover the basics of observability, including what it is, why it's important, and how to implement it effectively. We'll discuss the three pillars of observability: logs, metrics, and traces, and how to use them to gain a complete picture of your system's behavior. We'll also explore the various open-source tools and technologies available for observability.

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a solid understanding of observability and its importance in modern software development and operations. You'll also have practical knowledge of how to implement observability in your own systems and how to use it to detect and diagnose issues quickly and effectively.

So, let's get started!
