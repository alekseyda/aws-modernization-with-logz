# Logz.io Metrics Overvie

## Full visibility into infrastructure health and performance

Slice and dice your metric data to quickly gain insights into any component within ephemeral infrastructure. Track tens of thousands of metrics out-of-the-box with open source-based integrations like Prometheus or Logz.io’s [Telemetry Collector](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/telemetry-collector.html), while easily filtering out unneeded data to reduce costs.

## Centralize metrics from Prometheus and other sources

- Add just three lines of code to your Prometheus config files to begin forwarding your metrics to Logz.io for storage and analysis
- Monitor with Logz.io’s Telemetry Collector – a single agent that streams metrics, logs, and traces to Logz.io
- Collect metrics directly from AWS CloudWatch or an AWS Kinesis Firehose stream
- 18 months metric data retention to monitor long term infrastructure trends

## Investigate problems in context with data correlation

Find a sudden change in your metrics? Quickly investigate what caused the change by correlating your metrics with the relevant:

- **Logs:** Debug new problems right away
- **Traces:** Pinpoint problems in your microservices faster
- **Deployments:** See which deployments caused new problems

- Combine metrics alerts with log or trace alerts to improve accuracy
- Send alerting notifications to Slack, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, ServiceNow, Jira, and many more endpoints
