# Creating Dashboards

To effectively monitor and visualize the wealth of data collected by Prometheus, one of the most popular monitoring and alerting systems, Grafana has become the go-to tool for many observability enthusiasts. At the heart of Grafana's data analysis lies PromQL (Prometheus Query Language), a powerful query language that allows users to unlock the full potential of their Prometheus metrics. In this section we'll explore the capabilities of PromQL and demonstrate how it can be harnessed within Grafana to achieve unparalleled observability.

In the next sections we will learn some of the basics of PromQL and we will put everything together in dashboard.
