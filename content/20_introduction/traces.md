# Traces

## Introduction to Traces

Traces are a powerful tool for understanding how a system is behaving and identifying bottlenecks in performance. They allow you to see how different components of a system interact with each other and can help you quickly identify where issues are occurring. Traces can also be used to monitor the performance of a system over time and track changes in behavior.

### Types of Traces

There are different types of traces that can be collected, each serving a different purpose. For example, distributed traces are used to track requests or transactions as they move through a distributed system. This is particularly important in microservices architectures where requests can be routed through multiple services. Trace spans, on the other hand, are used to track a single operation within a service and can help you understand the behavior of that service in more detail.

### Implementing Traces

When implementing tracing, there are two approaches: auto-instrumentation and custom code. Auto-instrumentation involves using a tool that automatically instruments your code to collect traces. This approach is less intrusive and easier to implement, but it may not provide as much detail as custom code. Custom code involves adding tracing logic directly into your application code. This approach can provide more detailed information, but it is more complex and requires more development effort.

### Benefits of Traces

There are many benefits to using traces, including:

- **Improved understanding of system behavior:** Traces can help you to understand how different components of a system interact with each other and how they contribute to the overall performance of the system.
- **Identification of bottlenecks:** Traces can help you to identify bottlenecks in performance by showing you where requests or transactions are taking the longest to complete.
- **Monitoring of system performance over time:** Traces can be used to monitor the performance of a system over time and track changes in behavior. This can help you to identify trends and make necessary adjustments to improve performance.

### Challenges of Traces

There are also some challenges to using traces, including:

- **Increased overhead:** Traces can add some overhead to the application, which can impact performance.
- **Data volume:** Traces can generate a significant amount of data, which can be difficult to manage and analyze.
- **Security concerns:** Sensitive data may be included in trace data, so careful consideration must be given to ensure that trace data does not compromise the security of the system.

### Conclusion

Traces are a powerful tool for understanding how a system is behaving and identifying bottlenecks in performance. They can be used to improve the performance of a system, identify and resolve issues, and monitor the performance of a system over time. However, there are some challenges to using traces, such as increased overhead, data volume, and security concerns.
This defines what either happened or what is happening. This is an often overlooked but very important piece of proactive observability. Think through these items:

- What are the failures to a service that are critical enough to catch and alert immediately?
- What code can be added to a service to provide better insight into execution behavior (debugging and anomaly hunting)?
- Is there visibility end to end for transactions? If not, fix that immediately.

## Distributed Tracing

Tracing and distributed tracing are two important tools for understanding the performance of a system. Tracing is the process of collecting data about the execution of a request or transaction, while distributed tracing is the process of collecting data about the execution of a request or transaction as it moves through a distributed system.

In a traditional monolithic application, tracing is relatively straightforward. The tracing tool can simply instrument the application code to collect data about the execution of each request or transaction. However, in a distributed system, requests or transactions may be routed through multiple services, each of which may be running on a different machine. This makes it more difficult to collect data about the entire request or transaction, as the tracing tool must be able to instrument each service that the request or transaction touches.

Distributed tracing solves this problem by using a distributed tracing framework. A distributed tracing framework is a software library that helps to collect and aggregate data about the execution of a request or transaction as it moves through a distributed system. The distributed tracing framework typically uses a set of agents to collect data from each service that the request or transaction touches. The agents then send the data to a central collector, where it can be aggregated and analyzed.

### Challenges of Distributed Tracing

There are a number of challenges associated with distributed tracing, including:

- **Data volume:** Distributed tracing can generate a large amount of data. This data can be difficult to store and analyze.
- **Latency:** Distributed tracing can add latency to requests or transactions. This latency can be a problem for applications that are sensitive to performance.
- **Security:** Distributed tracing can introduce security concerns. Sensitive data may be included in trace data, so careful consideration must be given to ensure that trace data is not compromised.

### Conclusion

Tracing and distributed tracing are both important tools for understanding the performance of a system. Tracing is relatively straightforward in a traditional monolithic application, but it can be more difficult in a distributed system. Distributed tracing solves this problem by using a distributed tracing framework to collect and aggregate data about the execution of a request or transaction as it moves through a distributed system. However, there is a number of challenges associated with distributed tracing, including data volume, latency, and security.
