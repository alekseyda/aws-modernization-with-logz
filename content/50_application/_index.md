# OpenTelemetry Demo

Now that we have installed our observability stack we can deploy an application and start putting everything together.
In this section we will deploy the Astronomy shop which also known as the OpenTelemetry Demo.

The OpenTelemetry Demo consists of a series of micro services that are written in various languages to illustrate the power of OpenTelemetry. Click on the image below to englarge the micro services data flow.

The project has great documentation on how everything is put together, so if you want to know more about how each of the language was instrumented check out the links below.
